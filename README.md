```

When ready, initiate the generator:

```

## Notes

This repository hopes to be the starting point for future Laravel 5 applications.  
This repository is a work in progress, but basic functionality is working.  
I am hoping to get feature suggestions from people like you. Just create a new issue.  
This is what I am planning to add soon:
* moving laravel5_temp content into root folder
* fix order of dependency installation
* configure ellixir for popular choices (less, sass, coffee script, image optimization, jshint, jscs)
