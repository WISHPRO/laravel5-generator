> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Getting Started

npm install -g yo generator-laravel5
```

When ready, initiate the generator:

yo laravel5
```

## Notes

This repository hopes to be the starting point for future Laravel 5 applications.  
This repository is a work in progress, but basic functionality is working.  
I am hoping to get feature suggestions from people like you. Just create a new issue.  
This is what I am planning to add soon:
* copy bower, copy package.json, editorconfig and jshint
* ask for optional conf files
* fix elixir to use laravel-elixir-bower
* request to star the repository and submit feature requests at the end
* configure elixir for popular choices (less, sass, coffee script, image optimization, jshint, jscs)
* support javascript frameworks (check this [issue](https://github.com/jadjoubran/laravel5-generator/issues/2))
