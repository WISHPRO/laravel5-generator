```

When ready, initiate the generator:

```

## Notes

This repository hopes to be the starting point for future Laravel 5 applications.  
This repository is a work in progress, but basic functionality is working.  
I am hoping to get feature suggestions from people like you. Just create a new issue.  
This is what I am planning to add soon:
* copy bower, editorconfig and jshint (but ask the user first)
* parse package.json using JSON instead of regular expressions
* manage dependencies
* request to star the repository and submit feature requests at the end
* configure elixir for popular choices (less, sass, coffee script, image optimization, jshint, jscs)
* support javascript frameworks (check this [issue](https://github.com/jadjoubran/laravel5-generator/issues/2))
