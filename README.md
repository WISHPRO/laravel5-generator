## Notes

This repository hopes to be the starting point for future Laravel 5 applications.  
This repository is a work in progress, but basic functionality is working.  
I am hoping to get feature suggestions from people like you. Just create a new issue.  
This is what I am planning to add soon:
* fix npm 3 warning for peer dependency
* fix yeoman to deal with installation inside laravel folder (instead of root directory)
* manage dependencies
* configure elixir for popular choices (less, sass, coffee script, image optimization, jshint, jscs)
* support javascript frameworks (check this [issue](https://github.com/jadjoubran/laravel5-generator/issues/2))
